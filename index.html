          <p>The ghanian people are made up of hundreds of ethnic groups and tribes that have different cultural backgrounds and speak different languages, but all share the same technique in the naming of their children. </p>
          <p>The naming of their children is based on the respective day of the week the child was born, and based on what gender the child is.</p>
          <p>The Akan have defined the seven names of the week based on the gender of the child.</p>
